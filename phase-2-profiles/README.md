# Phase 2: Pioneer Profiles

## Overview

This phase creates comprehensive profiles of selected consciousness research pioneers, documenting their theories, evidence, methodologies, and influence on the field of non-materialistic consciousness studies.

## Phase Objectives

1. **Create detailed profiles** for 15-20 selected pioneers
2. **Document key theories** and contributions systematically
3. **Identify connections** between researchers and theories
4. **Build comprehensive understanding** of each figure's work

## Timeline

- **Duration:** 4 weeks
- **Start Date:** [To be filled]
- **Target Completion:** [To be filled]

## Deliverables

### 1. Individual Profile Files

   - Write comprehensive draft
   - Include all required sections

3. **Fact Checking**
   - Verify all claims
   - Check quotes and citations
   - Confirm dates and details

4. **Revision and Polish**
   - Ensure clarity and flow
   - Check consistency
   - Add cross-references

## Priority Order

### Tier 1 - Essential Profiles (Complete First)
1. [To be filled based on Phase 1]
2. 
3. 

### Tier 2 - Important Profiles
4. 
5. 
6. 

### Tier 3 - Supplementary Profiles
7. 
8. 
9. 

## Cross-Reference Categories

Document connections in these areas:
- **Theoretical Influences**: Who influenced whom
- **Collaborative Work**: Joint research or publications
- **Institutional Connections**: Shared affiliations
- **Conceptual Links**: Similar or related theories
- **Debates and Disagreements**: Intellectual conflicts
- **Successor Relationships**: Students and proteges

## File Naming Convention

- Individual profiles: `lastname-firstname.md`
- Draft versions: `DRAFT-lastname-firstname.md`
- Research notes: `notes-lastname-[date].md`

## Research Resources

### Primary Source Locations
- Academic databases
- University archives
- Personal websites
- Published works

### Key Journals
- Journal of Consciousness Studies
- Journal of Scientific Exploration
- Explore: Journal of Science and Healing
- [Others from Phase 1]

### Online Resources
- Academic repositories
- Video lectures
- Podcast interviews
- Conference proceedings

## Success Criteria

- All selected figures profiled
- Consistent quality across profiles
- Comprehensive cross-references
- Ready for Phase 3 analysis

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Limited Sources
- Use secondary sources carefully
- Note gaps in documentation
- Seek alternative materials

### Controversial Claims
- Present neutrally
- Include multiple perspectives
- Note evidence quality

### Complex Theories
- Break down systematically
- Use clear examples
- Provide context

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 2:
1. Review all profiles for consistency
2. Ensure cross-references are complete
3. Identify patterns for Phase 3
4. Prepare for thematic analysis
