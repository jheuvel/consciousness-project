# Phase 1: Research Foundation (In Progress)

## Overview

This phase establishes the foundation for our consciousness research project by identifying key figures, building a comprehensive source inventory, and recognizing preliminary patterns in non-materialistic consciousness theories.

**Status: IN PROGRESS**  
**Current Progress: 177 pioneers identified across 11 categories (expanded from initial 101)**

## Phase Objectives

1. **Identify 50-200 pioneering figures** in non-materialistic consciousness research
2. **Build comprehensive source inventory** including primary and secondary materials
3. **Establish research parameters** and methodology
4. **Document preliminary findings** and emerging patterns

## Deliverables

### 1. Figure Selection (`figure-selection.md`)
- Comprehensive list of selected pioneers
- Rationale for each selection
- Brief overview of their contributions
- Priority ranking for profile development

### 2. Source Inventory (`source-inventory.md`)
- Catalogued books, papers, and articles
- Online resources and databases
- Video/audio materials
- Archive locations

### 3. Preliminary Findings (`preliminary-findings.md`)
- Initial patterns observed
- Common themes emerging
- Unexpected discoveries
- Questions for deeper investigation

## Key Research Areas

### Consciousness Theories to Explore
- Quantum consciousness theories
- Information-based reality models
- Non-local consciousness research
- Transpersonal psychology
- Parapsychological studies
- Eastern philosophical approaches
- Holographic universe theories

### Types of Pioneers to Include
- Theoretical physicists exploring consciousness
- Neuroscientists with non-materialist views
- Philosophers of mind
- Parapsychology researchers
- Meditation and consciousness researchers
- Medical professionals studying NDEs/OBEs
- Systems theorists and cyberneticists

## Research Process

1. **Initial Brainstorming**
   - List all known figures in the field
   - Research recommendations and citations
   - Explore academic networks

2. **Preliminary Research**
   - Quick biography review for each candidate
   - Assess theoretical contributions
   - Check availability of sources

3. **Selection Process**
   - Apply selection criteria
   - Ensure diversity of perspectives
   - Balance historical and contemporary figures

4. **Source Gathering**
   - Locate primary works
   - Find biographical materials
   - Identify critical analyses
   - Note multimedia resources

## Working Methods

- Daily research sessions documented in research log
- Sources added to inventory as discovered
- Weekly review of progress
- Flexibility to add promising figures as discovered

## Success Criteria

- Minimum 15 high-quality pioneer selections
- At least 100 catalogued sources
- Clear patterns and themes identified
- Solid foundation for Phase 2 profiles

## File Organization

All Phase 1 files should follow this naming convention:
- Main deliverables: As specified above
- Research notes: `notes-[topic]-[date].md`
- Meeting notes: `meeting-[date].md`

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 1:
1. Review all selections with fresh perspective
2. Prioritize figures for Phase 2 profiling
3. Identify any gaps in coverage
4. Prepare profile template for Phase 2
