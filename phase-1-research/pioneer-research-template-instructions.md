**Priority Assignment:**
- **High Priority (28-35 points):** Definitely include in Phase 2
- **Medium Priority (21-27 points):** Strong candidates for inclusion
- **Low Priority (14-20 points):** Consider for brief profiles only

### 3. Core Contribution Summary
**Research Sources:** Primary works, academic summaries, biographical materials

- **Unique Insight:** What distinguishes them from others in the field
- **Primary Method:** Empirical research, philosophical analysis, contemplative practice, artistic expression, etc.

### 4. Essential Sources
**Research Strategy:**
1. **Start with primary sources** - their most important original works
2. **Look for academic treatments** - scholarly books/papers about them
3. **Check availability** - note if sources are easily accessible or require special access

**Access Codes:**
- **Available:** Easily found online, in libraries, or in print
- **Need to find:** Requires research to locate
- **Archive:** Requires special collection or archive access
- **Purchase:** Available but requires buying

**Source Types:**
- **Books:** Major published works
- **Papers:** Academic journal articles
- **Teachings:** Recorded lectures, talks, or traditional teachings
- **Interviews:** Audio/video interviews or documented conversations

### 5. Quick Theoretical Framework
**Research Focus:** Their core claims about consciousness and reality
- **Core Premise:** Their fundamental assertion about consciousness/reality (1-2 sentences)
- **Key Concepts:** 3-5 central terms they developed or used distinctively
- **Evidence/Support:** What types of evidence they relied on (experimental data, personal experience, logical argument, traditional authority, etc.)

### 6. Academic Standing
**Research Sources:** Academic databases, citation indexes, scholarly reviews
- **Mainstream Reception:** How conventional academia views their work
- **Empirical Support:** Scientific studies supporting/challenging their claims
- **Major Criticisms:** Key objections from scholars or scientists
- **Bridge Potential:** Aspects that could connect to mainstream science

### 7. Influence Network & Relationships
**Research Strategy:** Look for explicit acknowledgments, citations, biographical connections

**Finding Influences ON them:**
- Check acknowledgments in their major works
- Look for biographical information about their education, teachers, readings
- Note which traditions or thinkers they frequently cite or reference

**Finding Influences BY them:**
- Look for citations of their work in others' writings
- Check for students, followers, or people who explicitly build on their ideas
- Note if they founded movements, schools, or institutions

**Influence Strength Assessment:**
- **Major (üî¥):** Explicitly acknowledged as fundamental influence, extensive citing, or biographical evidence of major impact
- **Moderate (üü°):** Clear influence but not foundational, occasional citing
- **Minor (üü¢):** Mentioned as influence but limited evidence of impact
- **Mutual (üîµ):** Evidence of back-and-forth exchange, collaboration, or co-development

### 8. Cultural Context
**Research Sources:** Historical overviews, cultural studies, period-specific materials
- **Historical Period:** Major cultural/intellectual movements of their time
- **Cultural Background:** Their religious, philosophical, or cultural foundation
- **Social Impact:** How their work affected broader society or culture

### 9. Cross-Reference & Thought Tree Integration
**Research Process:**
1. **Check our pioneer database** - Which of our 101 pioneers connect to this person?
2. **Identify their school/cluster** - What movement or tradition do they belong to?
3. **Map thought chains** - Who came before and after them in developing similar ideas?
4. **Assess bridge role** - Do they connect different traditions or schools?
5. **Evaluate network centrality** - How many other pioneers connect to them?

### 10. Profile Development Notes
**Strategic Assessment:**
- **Research Priority:** Why this person matters for our project
- **Profile Type:** Based on priority score and source availability
- **Key Questions:** Specific things to investigate further
- **Challenges:** Any difficulties in researching this figure
- **Cross-Reference Opportunities:** Which other pioneers to compare

## Research Workflow

### Step 1: Quick Assessment (30 minutes)
1. Fill out basic information
2. Do quick selection criteria rating
3. Identify 2-3 primary sources
4. Write core contribution summary

### Step 2: Deep Research (1-2 hours)
1. Complete source inventory
2. Map theoretical framework
3. Research academic standing
4. Investigate influence networks

### Step 3: Integration (30 minutes)
1. Complete cross-reference section
2. Write development notes
3. Update research log
4. Add to master influence database

## Quality Standards

### Minimum Requirements
- At least 3 primary sources identified
- Selection criteria assessment completed
- Basic influence mapping done
- Academic standing assessed

### Excellence Indicators
- Multiple source types (books, papers, multimedia)
- Clear influence chains documented
- Bridge-building potential identified
- Integration opportunities noted

## Common Research Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Confirmation Bias:** Don't just look for positive assessments
2. **Western Bias:** Include non-Western perspectives and sources
3. **Temporal Bias:** Consider how views have changed over time
4. **Academic Tunnel Vision:** Look beyond just academic sources
5. **Influence Oversimplification:** Influence can be complex and bidirectional

## Tools and Resources

### Primary Research Sources
- Google Scholar for academic papers
- Library databases for books and articles
- YouTube/audio platforms for recorded teachings
- Institutional websites for biographical information
- Archive.org for historical materials

### Influence Mapping Resources

## Template Usage for Claude Code

When instructing Claude Code to fill out templates:

1. **Provide the specific pioneer name** and basic information
2. **Specify which sections to focus on** based on available time
3. **Give access to relevant sources** or ask Claude to identify them
4. **Request specific research priorities** (e.g., focus on influence mapping)
5. **Ask for source citations** for all claims made
6. **Request assessment of research confidence** for each section

### Example Claude Code Instruction:
"Using the pioneer research template, please create a research profile for David Chalmers. Focus particularly on his influence network and academic standing. Provide citations for all major claims and assess the strength of evidence for each section."
