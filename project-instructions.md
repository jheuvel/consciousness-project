# Exploration of Consciousness: Project Instructions

## Project Overview
**Objective:** Explore non-materialistic (alternative) views of the fundamentals of reality by examining different theories of consciousness and identifying common ideas between pioneers in this field.

## Project Scope and Definitions

### Focus Areas
- **Primary Focus:** Non-materialistic theories of consciousness
- **Secondary Focus:** Alternative views on the nature of reality and mind
- **Time Period:** Historical to contemporary (spanning from ancient philosophy to modern consciousness research)
- **Approach:** Interdisciplinary (philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, physics, mysticism, and consciousness studies)

### Key Terms and Concepts
- **Non-materialistic consciousness theories:** Perspectives that view consciousness as fundamental rather than emergent from matter
- **Alternative reality frameworks:** Idealism, panpsychism, dual-aspect monism, and other non-reductionist approaches
- **Pioneer criteria:** Individuals who significantly advanced non-materialistic consciousness theory through original research, writing, or experiential exploration

## Phase 1: Identification of Influential Figures

### Target Scale
- **Primary Goal:** 20-50 figures for comprehensive coverage
- **Profile Flexibility:** Shorter initial profiles with option to expand for key figures
- **Depth Strategy:** Core profiles for essential figures, briefer entries for supporting voices

### Selection Criteria for "Pioneers" (Open-Minded Approach)
1. **Theoretical Innovation or Insight:** Offered original perspectives, experiences, or frameworks - regardless of academic acceptance
2. **Authentic Exploration:** Demonstrated genuine inquiry into consciousness, even if conclusions were unconventional
3. **Cross-Domain Thinking:** Connected insights from diverse fields (science, spirituality, arts, indigenous wisdom, mysticism)
4. **Direct Experience Integration:** Valued first-person experience, contemplative practice, or altered states as valid sources of knowledge
5. **Paradigm Expansion:** Questioned fundamental assumptions about reality, consciousness, or the nature of existence
6. **Intellectual Courage:** Pursued ideas despite potential academic or social criticism
7. **Synthetic Thinking:** Attempted to bridge seemingly incompatible worldviews or knowledge systems

### Academic Validity Considerations
While maintaining an open-minded approach, each profile should include:
- **Academic Reception:** How the figure's work was/is viewed by mainstream academia
- **Empirical Support:** Available scientific evidence supporting or challenging their theories
